Frontend Nanodegree project

Javascript application for cat clicker game

Based on [Cat Clicker Premium](https://github.com/cajoue/cat-clicker-premium) 

**Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium MVO**

_Visuals_

* The application should display
    - [ ] a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
    - [ ] an area to display the selected cat
* In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
    - [ ] the cat's name
    - [ ] a picture of the cat
    - [ ] text showing the number of clicks

The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

_Interaction_

* [ ] When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
* [ ] The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.

**To Do:**
* Review existing Cat Clicker Premium
* Plan separation of concerns
* 

**Thoughts/Mods**
* maybe go back to just using json for the cats and not use classes
* don't show/hide the cats, try DOM manipulation instead
* use html file for more content structure instead of building it all in js
